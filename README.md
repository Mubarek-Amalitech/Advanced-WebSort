# Project Documentation: RESTful API and Sorting Algorithms Implementation

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a RESTful API adhering to HATEOAS principles and developing a Spring-based web application. It also incorporates various sorting algorithms for data processing.

---

## Key Objectives

### 1. **RESTful API with HATEOAS Principles**
   - Design and implement a RESTful API following HATEOAS principles using Servlets or the Spring Framework.
   - Provide API endpoints for CRUD operations on a sample dataset.
   - Ensure the API includes proper hypermedia controls for guiding clients.

### 2. **Apache Tomcat Web Server**
   - Configure and deploy the application on an Apache Tomcat web server.
   - Ensure proper handling of HTTP protocols, including requests and responses.

### 3. **Spring Framework**
   - Build a Spring-based web application utilizing:
     - **Modules** for modular design.
     - **Dependency Injection (DI)** and **Autowiring** for managing dependencies.
     - **Application Context** for bean lifecycle management.
   - Demonstrate Spring features through a sample application.

### 4. **Sorting Algorithms**
   - Implement and integrate the following sorting algorithms:
     - Heap Sort
     - Quick Sort
     - Merge Sort
     - Radix Sort
     - Bucket Sort
   - Provide a user interface for selecting and executing these algorithms on a sample dataset.

   - Showcase the implementation in a sample Spring application.

### **Sorting Algorithms**
   - Implement the following algorithms:
     - Heap Sort
     - Quick Sort
     - Merge Sort
     - Radix Sort
     - Bucket Sort
   - Integrate these algorithms for data manipulation within the application.
   - Provide an interface for selecting and executing sorting algorithms on sample datasets.

## User Stories

### As a Developer:
   - I want to configure a RESTful API adhering to HATEOAS principles to enhance API usability.
   - I want to deploy the application on an Apache Tomcat web server for production readiness.
   - I want to use the Spring Framework to create modular and scalable applications.

### As a User:
   - I want to interact with an API for CRUD operations on data with hypermedia guidance.
   - I want to sort datasets using various algorithms and analyze their results.
   - I want an easy-to-use interface to select and execute sorting algorithms.

## How to Use
1. **Setup Apache Tomcat:**
   - Deploy the application WAR file to your Tomcat server.
   - Ensure proper configuration in the `server.xml` or `web.xml` file for deployment.

2. **API Interaction:**
   - Use tools like Postman to test RESTful API endpoints.
   - Perform CRUD operations and observe HATEOAS-compliant responses.

3. **Sorting Feature:**
   - Access the application UI.
   - Upload or select a sample dataset.
   - Choose a sorting algorithm to execute and view sorted results.
